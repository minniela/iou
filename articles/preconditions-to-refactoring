Identify Any and All External Dependencies
  - While in Salesforce this is less challenging than a Java stack, as in the passage below, Salesforce is a large
    ecosystem and developers are creative. If you have any code that is called externally, or any other dependencies
    that would hamper refactoring, think them through. Luckily with this approach, you are less likely to get lost
    in the complexity of refactoring, but you don't want to find out the hard way that some consultant hacked together
    some API and now it's breaking.
  - "There is no problem changing a method name if you have access to all the code that calls that
    method. Even if the method is public, as long as you can reach and change all the callers, you
    can rename the method. There is a problem only if the interface is being used by code that you
    cannot find and change. When this happens, I say that the interface becomes a published
    interface (a step beyond a public interface)."

Log and Organize Your Apex Exception Emails
  - This provides a good benchmark and is telling to report on. It is quite nice to hear that {N} CPU Timeouts and
    SOQL 101 errors stopped reporting.
